		<Text>Austria-Hungary was a state in central Europe that aimed to continue the Habsburg Empire in this new form. Owing to the vast amount of cultures within it, Austria-Hungary was often unstable politically, and had ethnic infighting for much of its existence. Founded as a result of the Compromise of 1867, unity in the region was fragile. Austria and Hungary remained distinct entities within the state, each having their own passports despite being legally part of the same country. The union was far more a personal monarchical union than a full-scale political one, as most regions had a significant degree of autonomy, with centralised matters only being to do with defence and the like. Throughout the 19th century, Austria-Hungary prospered, as a cultural capital of the world. However, due to the close alliance with the upstart German Empire, Austria-Hungary found itself isolated from many other countries around it. In the south, the Serbs were desperate to regain lands incorporated into Austria-Hungary, despite them having only got independence a few years beforehand. As an ally of Russia, Serbia was able to push these claims. In 1914, Austria-Hungary sent an ultimatum to Serbia, stating that if they did not agree with all of the points, then they would be in a state of war. The points were so power-taking that the Austro-Hungarian Empire did not think they could possibly agree, thus giving them a casus belli; however, much to their surprise and disappointment, the Serbs agreed with everything aside from one clause in point six of the ultimatum. Angered, Austria-Hungary invaded anyway. However, with incredibly outdated military not ready to even fight against the upstart Serbian nation, Austria-Hungary succumed to its weakness in having too many ethnicities held in the one state against their will. Though Austria tried to incorporate itself into the remnants of the German Empire, the newfound League of Nations denied this, instead splitting Central Europe into more or less what it is today.</Text>
